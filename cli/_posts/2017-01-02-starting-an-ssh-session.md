title: Starting an SSH Session
short: SSH into Containers
category: cli
order: 2
---

---

### Usage
`runnable ssh [repository]`

Use this command to spawn a shell session into the container.

---

`[repository] format: <repo-name>/<branch-name>.`

Without `[repository]`, the current directory will be used to determine `<repo-name>/<branch-name>`.

---

1. In your terminal, navigate to the local directory of a repository whose container is running in Runnable.

2. Start an ssh session
  `runnable ssh`.

  > To ssh into another container on runnable, add the name of the repository as the last argument

  For example, if you'd like to ssh into the runnable container called *api/feature-1*, the command would be:

  `runnable ssh api/feature-1`.

3. You will now be in an ssh session with a container on Runnable that maps to the branch you have checked out locally.
