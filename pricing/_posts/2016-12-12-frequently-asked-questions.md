### Here’s how we calculate your bill each month:

1. We automatically determine which [plan](//runnable.com/pricing/) your team is on based on the number of services your team is using, and subtract any services used for testing (testing is free at the moment!).
2. We figure out how many users your team had on Runnable, and prorate for users that were not present for the full month.
3. The amount your team is charged is the cost of that plan multiplied by the number of users in your team.

### What is a service?
A service is a repository or other service (like a database) that Runnable will create containers for. The number of services your team will need is roughly the number of services that make up your application.

---

### How are services calculated with Docker Compose?
The number of services your team uses is the same as the number of services defined in each Compose file you add.

---

### What is a user?
A user is anyone who is able to make changes to your account, and have their branches deployed and kept up-to-date on Runnable.

---

### How do I remove a user?
That feature is coming soon. For now, please contact us via the in-app chat or by [email](mailto:support@runnable.com) to remove users.

---

### What happens when a user is added or removed?
We’ll prorate the cost of users daily, so your team will only pay for the time your users are active.

---

### How do I change my plan?
We automatically determine your plan at end of every billing cycle based on the number of services your team is using.

---

### Why isn’t there a free plan?
Runnable will remain free for your team’s first 14 days. If your development team believes our pricing plans are not well-suited for your needs, please [get in touch](mailto:support@runnable.com) with us.

### I have more questions.
No problem! [Email us](mailto:support@runnable.com) and we’d be happy to help.
