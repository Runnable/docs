### Q: How is my bill calculated?
At the end of your monthly billing cycle, we automatically determine which plan your team is on based on the number of configuration templates it is using. The amount you are charged is equal to the cost of that plan multiplied by the number of users in your team. We'll charge a prorated amount for users that were not present for the full month.
 
### Q: What is a configuration template?
A configuration template corresponds to a repository or other service (like a database) that Runnable will create containers for. The number of templates your team will need is roughly the number of services that make up your application.
 
### Q: What is a user?
A user is anyone who is able to make changes to your account, and have their branches deployed and kept up-to-date on Runnable.
 
### Q: How do I remove a user?
That feature is coming soon. For now, please contact us to remove users.
 
### Q: What happens when a user is added or removed?
We'll prorate the cost of users daily, so you'll only pay for the time your users are active.
 
### Q: How do I change my plan?
We automatically determine your plan at end of every billing cycle based on the number of configuration templates your team is using.
 
### Q: Why isn’t there a free plan?
Runnable will remain free for your team's first 14 days. If your development team believes our pricing plans are not well-suited for your needs, please get in touch with us.
 
### Q: I have more questions.
No problem! Email us and we’d be happy to help.
