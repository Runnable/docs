### Here’s how we calculate your bill each month:

1. We figure out how many users your team had on Runnable, and prorate for users that were not present for the full month.
2. The amount your team is charged is the cost of your [plan](//runnable.com/pricing) multiplied by the number of users in your team.

### What is a user?
A user is anyone who is able to make changes to your account, and have their branches deployed and kept up-to-date on Runnable.

---

### How do I remove a user?
That feature is coming soon. For now, please contact us via the in-app chat or by [email](mailto:support@runnable.com) to remove users.

---

### What happens when a user is added or removed?
We’ll prorate the cost of users daily, so your team will only pay for the time your users are active.

### I have more questions.
No problem! [Email us](mailto:support@runnable.com) and we’d be happy to help.
