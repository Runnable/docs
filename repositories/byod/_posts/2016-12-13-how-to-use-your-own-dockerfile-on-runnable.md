One of the easiest ways to take advantage of the Runnable platform is to use your own Dockerfile. Usually, developers keep a Dockerfile within their application repository in order to maintain a build and runtime environment for their code. Since Runnable's underlying infrastructure is built on top of Docker, we can simply use the configuration from your revisioned Dockerfile to build your containers.

### Here's how you can set up your service to use your own Dockerfiles:

When creating a service, you are prompted to select a *Setup Method*. Make sure to choose the option for a Dockerfile in your repo. You will now be prompted to enter the correct path to your Dockerfile. This is the relative path within your repository.

> For example, if your Dockerfile is in a folder called docker/ within your repository, your relative path would be docker/Dockerfile
