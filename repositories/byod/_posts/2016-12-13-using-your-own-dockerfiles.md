Dockerfiles are often used for managing configuration and automating the build process for a service. If your repositories have Dockerfiles, it’s easy to get them set up in Runnable. At the end of this guide, you'll have a running container for a repository, built from its Dockerfile.

> Note: Using your own Dockerfiles is a great way to start using Runnable, but some features are reserved for apps that [use Docker Compose]({{ site.baseurl }}/docker-compose/launching-your-first-environment):

## Adding Your Repository

From the Containers page, click the **Add Services** button and select a repository that uses a Dockerfile. We'll be using the Dockerfile in the default branch (set on GitHub) to build and run a container. Later, you'll be able to launch containers for additional branches of this repository.

In the modal that appears, click the **No Compose File** tab. Then select **Use a Dockerfile in your repo** and type in the path for your Dockerfile, relative to the root of your repository. You'll see a green check when we find a matching file.

Then click the **Create Environment** button to continue.

## Using Your Containers

Runnable will create a container for the default branch of the repository, using the Dockerfile you specified. If your Dockerfile uses a private image, you’ll need to [set up Runnable to access your registry]({{ site.baseurl }}/repositories/byod/using-private-docker-images) so the container can build successfully.

Once the container is running, you can interact with the terminal or open its URL to view its web output.

By default, you’ll also get new environments for branches of this repository when you push to GitHub. Pushes from other collaborators who have joined Runnable will also trigger new environments.
