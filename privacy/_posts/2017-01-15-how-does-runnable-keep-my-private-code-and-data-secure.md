### We follow a single tenant model.
* Every GitHub org gets its own dedicated walled infrastructure.
* Only members of your GitHub org have access to your private infrastructure.

### We make sure your code is safe.
* Your code gets pulled directly to your Github Org’s private infrastructure.
* Our application layer doesn’t have access to your code.

### We take security seriously.
* We are regularly audited by a leading security firm.
