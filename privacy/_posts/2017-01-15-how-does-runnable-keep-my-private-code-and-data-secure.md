### We follow a single tenant model.
Every GitHub org gets its own dedicated walled infrastructure.

---

### We make sure your code is safe.
Your code gets pulled directly to your Github Org’s private infrastructure. Our application layer doesn’t have access to your code.

---

### We take security seriously.
We are regularly audited by a leading security firm.

### Questions?
Get in touch. We’d love to hear from you.
