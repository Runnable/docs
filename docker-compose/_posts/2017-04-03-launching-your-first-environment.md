Runnable makes it easy to launch containers from your compose file. 

### Configuring your first repository


Let's walkthrough configuring an example repository. The repository we will configure has the following Docker compose file:
  ![GitHub Organization People]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/compose_config_composefile.png)

From compose file, it is clear that we expect to see 2 containers launch for this repository: a web container and a db container. To configure this repository on Runnable,

1. Go to your org on the Runnable.com

2. Click on the "Add services" button.

3. Find the repository where the compose file lives, and select it.

4. You will now see the configuration modal with the 'Compose' tab selected.

5. You can give your environment a name. This name will be used to identify the group of the containers in your Compose file going forward.

6. To configure a staging environment, ensure that the staging toggled is clicked open.

7. Specify the path of the Docker Compose file in the repository. The path should be relative to the root of the repo.

8. Click on "Create Environment".

9. You will now see the 2 containers running for the master branch of your repository. Note the name of the containers is the same name you gave them as in the Docker compose file.

10. Each container on Runnable gets a unique URL for external HTTP/HTTPs access.

11. Your master environment should be up! Yuo can explore the environment using the URL, Terminal and Filebrowser.

###  Launching a Full-Stack environment for a branch

Now that you have setup your environment, you can instantly get a clone of this environment for each branch you or your teammates work with. To do this:

1. Find your repository on the sidebar.
  ![GitHub Organization People]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/compose_branch_side_bar.png)

2. Click on the "Add a branch button".

3. Ensure that the toggle on the top of the branch pop over is toggled on. This will ensure that branches are created as they appear on GitHub.

4. Now push a change to the repository Github.com, on an existing branch other than master.

5. You will notice that a full-stack environment for your branch is launched right away on the sidebar.

6. You can now use your branch's environment to verify or debug you and your teammates changes.
