### Supported Versions

Runnable currently supports the Docker Compose version 2 file format. Unsupported options are listed below.

### Unsupported Options

The current service configuration options are unsupported at this time, and will simply be ignored by Runnable if they are present in your Compose YAML file. 

> If these unsupported options prevent your environment from building and running on Runnable, please let us know. You can reach out via our in-app chat (Intercom) or via email at [support@runnable.com](mailto:support@runnable.com?subject=Docker%20Compose%20-%20Unsupported%20Options).
