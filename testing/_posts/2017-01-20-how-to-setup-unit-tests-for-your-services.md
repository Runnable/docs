Runnable makes it easy to setup testing for your services using Compose.

---

### Configuring your unit tests

The repository we will configure has a Docker compose file. From this Compose file, it is clear that we expect to see 2 containers launch for this repository: a Web container and a DB container.

### How to configure this repository on Runnable

1. Go to your **Organization** on Runnable.

2. Click on the **Add Services** button and select the repository where the Compose file is tracked
  ![Add Repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/testing-add-repo.png)

3. You will now see the configuration modal with the **Compose** tab selected. Here you can name your service, etc.
  ![Configure Service]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/testing-add-service.png)

4. To configure a testing environment, ensure that the testing is toggled on.
  ![Enable Testing]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/testing-enable-testing.png)

5. Specify the path of the Docker Compose file in the repository. The path should be relative to the root of the repository.
  ![Specify Docker-Compose Path]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/testing-type-name.png)

6. Next, select the service that you will be running tests from. Github integration will be applied to this service.
