The __Runnable Environments for JIRA integration__ is a connect add-on for JIRA Software Cloud. This integration automatically adds the 'Environments' panel to JIRA tickets providing status and links to Runnable containers.

Runnable environments are associated with JIRA issues when the issue key is present in the GitHub branch name.

This add-on creates an "Environments" panel to display the following information:

* Link to view Runnable output
* Deployment status of changes on Runnable
* Link to manage the environment on Runnable


__Installation__

To install the integration, complete the following steps:

1. From JIRA administration, go to Add-ons > Manage add-ons and search the Marketplace for `Runnable`.  
  ![Install Runnable Environments for JIRA]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jira4.png)
   
2. Click "Install".

3. Contact [Runnable Support](mailto:support@runnable.com) to enable the integration by providing your __Atlassian Site URL__ and __GitHub Organization Name__.
