The __Runnable Environments for JIRA integration__ automatically adds the 'Environments' panel to JIRA tickets providing status and links to Runnable containers. This is a connect add-on for JIRA Software Cloud. 

To preview the integration (currently in `beta`), complete the following steps:

1. From JIRA administration, go to Add-ons > Manage add-ons > Settings.  
    ![JIRA 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jira1.png)

3. From JIRA administration, go to Add-ons > Manage add-ons > Upload add-on.
