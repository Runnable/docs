If your project is failing to build, you may need to [add an SSH key]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/adding-ssh-keys) so it can access any private repositories it depends on.

Errors related to this issue can take a variety of forms depending on your application, including:

```
no such key
```

```
host key verification failed
```

```
npm ERR! exited with error code: 128
```
