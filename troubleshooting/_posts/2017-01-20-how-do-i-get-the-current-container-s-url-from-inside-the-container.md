================

There can be many reasons why knowing the [Web URL](networking/runnable_urls.md) of a container is required when setting up on Runnable. Here is a walk through that can explain how to generate the Web URL of a given container. 

A ```Web URL``` of a container is derivied from its ```Template URL``` i.e. ```Web URL``` = ```Container ID``` + ```-``` + ```Template URL````.

Let's assume that you are working with a container launched from the ```Web``` template, under your Github Org ```AcmeOrg```.

The Template URL of this container is ````Web-staging-AcmeOrg.runnableapp.com````. Now the only thing we need to generate the ```Web URL``` of this container is its ```Container ID```` -- this value can be read from the special environment variable ```RUNNABLE_CONTAINER_ID```. This environment variable is injected into all containers on Runnable. 

Here is an example of how you can get the URL in Node.js through string concatenation: 

```var web_url=process.env.RUNNABLE_CONTAINER_ID + Web-staging-AcmeOrg.runnableapp.com```
