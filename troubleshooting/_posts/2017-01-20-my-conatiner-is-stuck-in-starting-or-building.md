If your container seems to be stuck in the building or starting state, you can try to rebuild it without cache—this will rebuild your container from a fresh state. To rebuild without cache:

1. Click on the **Status** button.
2. Click on **Rebuild Without Cache**.

If your container is _still_ stuck after rebuilding without cache, contact us using the in-app chat messenger.
