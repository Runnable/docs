If your container seems to be stuck in the building or starting state, you can try to rebuild it without cacheâ€” this will rebuild your container from a fresh state.

---

### To rebuild without cache:

1. Click on the **Status** button.
2. Click on **Rebuild Without Cache**.
  ![Rebuild Without Cache]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rebuild-wo-cache.png)

If your container is _still_ stuck after rebuilding without cache, contact us using the in-app chat messenger.
